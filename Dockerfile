# ONE image carries both. They are released together and share the condition
# vocabulary: internal/agent's catalog classifies every reason api/v1alpha
# declares, and the manager's controllers are what write those reasons. Two
# separately tagged images could drift into a skew nothing prevents — an
# assistant answering "no catalog entry for this reason" on exactly the
# failures it exists to explain. Each Deployment picks its binary with
# `command`; see config/base/manager and config/components/compute-mcp.

# Build
# the GOARCH has not a default value to allow the binary be built according to the host where the command
# was called. For example, if we call make docker-build in a local env which has the Apple Silicon M1 SO
# the docker BUILDPLATFORM arg will be linux/arm64 when for Apple x86 it will be linux/amd64. Therefore,
# by leaving it empty we can ensure that the container and binary shipped on it will have the same platform.
#
# Both binaries build in one stage so the dependency tree they share — 816 of
# compute-mcp's 845 packages are already in the manager's — compiles once.

# The nonroot variant has no shell and no package manager, which matters most
# for compute-mcp: it is the process an untrusted model's tool calls reach. The
# manager binary now sits beside it there, and grants it nothing — it is a
# controller, not an execution primitive, and the compute-mcp pod holds no
# credential it could use (an unbound ServiceAccount, a credential-free
# kubeconfig). See config/components/compute-mcp/service_account.yaml.
