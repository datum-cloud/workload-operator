### Instance.spec.networkInterfaces[index]
<sup><sup>[↩ Parent](#instancespec)</sup></sup>



InstanceNetworkInterface describes one interface an instance needs. The
fields beyond `network` and `networkPolicy` are copied verbatim onto the
NetworkInterfaceClaim created for each instance slot, so they carry the same
meaning, defaults, and immutability the claim API defines.

The location an interface is claimed in is implicit: the claim is created in
the control plane serving the instance, which is already location scoped.

Retain when an address is published in DNS, allowed through a firewall, or
otherwise depended on from outside.
